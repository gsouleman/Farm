The HTML structure currently has:
- Left column (flex: 0 0 35%) containing:
  - Location & Specifications card
  - Crop Allocation card (THIS SHOULDN'T BE HERE)
-Right column: MISSING/EMPTY

What needs to happen:
Move the Crop Allocation card from inside the left column div to become the right column div.

Current structure from HTML view (lines 248-323):
- Line 251: Close Location & Specifications card
- Line 252: Empty line
- Line 253-321: Crop Allocation card (INSIDE left column - WRONG!)
- Line 323: End Two Column Layout

SOLUTION: Need to close the left column div after line 251, then start a new right column div containing the Crop Allocation card.
